## Background
Acme Robotics is launching a brand new robotics-based product next year but their small development team is falling behind. They’ve reached out to out team to help them get back on track.

Our task is to design a perception module of their robotics-based components using high-quality software engineering practices so their team can take our deliverable, finish development and integrate it into the product.
